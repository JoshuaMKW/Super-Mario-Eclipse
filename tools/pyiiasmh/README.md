**Python:**
  This method of usage requires that you have installed a version newer than or equal to Python 3.8.x and added it to your `PATH`. You also need to install PyQt5, which can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/
  This can be done through cmd, as `pip install PyQt5`, or as a manual install.

**Executable:**
  This method of usage requires that you are running either `Windows 64bit` or `Linux 64bit`.
  After these things are taken care off, you can simply run the program like any other

Once you have these things set up, simply run PyiiASMH 3 by using the optional desktop shortcut, or by executing the command `pyiiasmh` in the terminal
